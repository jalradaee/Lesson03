        <h2>Photographer</h2>

        <p>Hi I’m Jihan Alradaee, 

          My interest in photography started when I was a little girl observing my Father. He was the photographer of the family taking pictures of us while we were playing, watching TV or vacationing. He not only was interested in capturing the moments but was also preserving them in albums and folders. I have been attracted to photography since I remember. 
          
          Ever since I was able to take a picture or a video I was the de facto video/photo expert of my family and friends circle. Using my first Canon film camera and Sony camcorder that my mom gave me as a gift  I used to take pictures on special occasions . Then I used to store the final product  in CD’s or Dropbox . I also developed editing skills using software programs available at that time. 
          
          When I moved to Seattle I continued my service to friends and family. I also furthered my interest in photography by taking a class at Highline Community College in 2014. I learned a lot about the rich field of photography and editing using Lightroom. I continued my voluntary work in weddings, birthdays and other social events, then sharing the pictures via social media.   
          
          In 2015 I moved to Raleigh and continued my photography career by taking more classes at Wake Tech Community College and enrolling in Web Development and Graphics design certificates. I worked with photoshop editing and enhancing photos that I have taken all over Raleigh and the surrounding. The photos that I take are Portrait, Street Photography, Nature and Micro Photography. 
          
          My mission is to use my camera to show people the beauty that is in them or the beauty that is around them that they do not pay attention to.</p>
